====== My World Model ======

''Better ways of thinking, feeling, and acting - around problems of philosophy, rationality, knowledge-aquisition (epistemology), self and society, ethics, purpose, and value.''

(this intro text was stolen inspired by meaningness.com, authoured by the genius David Chapman, go check it out!)

This repository contains my personal views on the world.
Beware: my world might look different than yours. My world is WEIRD (western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic).
Updated as my beliefs change, this method of writing a hyperbook seems much more suitable for the modern world.

===== Overview =====

At this point of time I haven't written anything. These things might be part of my hypertext book:

- Models of philosophy

- Models of the good life in terms of physiology

- Models on democratic citizenship

- Models on rationality

- Models on debate culture (avoid the internet at all costs)

- Models on epistemology

- Models on changing the world

- Random trivia thrown into a text which would be better without it

Thanks!
