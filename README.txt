====== My World Model ======

This repository contains my views on the world.
Updated as my beliefs change, this method of writing a... //book//(?) seems much more suitable for the modern world.

===== Overview =====

At this point of time I haven't written anything. These things might be part of my hypertext book:

- Models of philosophy

- Models of the good life in terms of physiology

- Models on democratic citizenship

- Models on rationality

- Models on debate culture (avoid the internet at all costs)

- Models on epistemology

- Models on changing the world

- Random trivia thrown into a text which would be better without it

Thanks!
