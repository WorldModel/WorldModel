TODO

====== About the author ======

I like to think and I am living in Braunschweig, Lower Saxony, Germany.
This is my... uh... //blog// or something? Hyper-text internet book? Personal propaganda?
I guess the reader needs to interpret me as an author. I can't (won't) provide that.

But is it truly earth? No. It's just a 2D map op the light waves boucing off earth, into very complicated optics, distorted, denoised, balanced and published by NASA. Thanks, NASA!
Oh and also... I changed the hue in case you haven't noticed. I took the liberty to take the true-color represantation of earth and (just to fool you, personally) modify it slightly. Ha!
